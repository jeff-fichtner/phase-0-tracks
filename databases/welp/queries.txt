You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

select * from reviews
	join users on users.id = reviews.user_id
	join businesses on businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

1|3|It was ok.|2|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|2|Amir's Towing
2|4|I liked it.|4|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|4|Lotus Yoga
3|1|The actual worst. Couldn't see anything.|1|4|4|Steven|Wonder|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel

______________________________

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

select users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment from reviews
	join users on reviews.user_id = users.id
	join businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

select * from reviews
	join users on users.id = reviews.user_id
	join businesses on businesses.id = reviews.business_id
	where businesses.name = "Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
