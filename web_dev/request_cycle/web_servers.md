##Release 1: Research Web Servers

What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

>It seems the most important idea behind the os is the os assumes everyone is computer literate, knows what they're doing and can handle all of the power written into the os. Other popular os's, whether they have the ability to access this power, hide it behind a GUI that keeps the most unadventurous from falling off a computer cliff. Other aspects of Linux's design is its efficiency; each program is short and extremely effective.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

>A VPS hosts an entire os on a shared dedicated physical server. So, while it doesn't technically exist in its own physical space, it operates as if it is, and provides superuser access to the owner. This allows us, for very little money, to create a virtual computer and allow it to interact with the internet.


Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

>By running programs on a separate user, the programs will not have access to the entire os, and will require permission to modify anything of importance.
