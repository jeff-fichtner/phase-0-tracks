<p>I looked at the code for <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>. They have a photography website, and it's extremely intuitive to use. A search form directly front and center, with a photo in the background, and then "part II" is just below, and opens to a smooth arrangement (unlike my table).  I recognize most of the code, and figure a lot of the rest is either advanced features (like a drop down menu in a search bar) or CSS.  In other words, I can at least easily make out the block-level stuff. The only problem is the heading text. The first text you see on the page is boring, due to a poor font choice.</p>
